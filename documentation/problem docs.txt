Project Issues & Fix Documentation
==================================

1. Transaction "All Time" Section Performance
---------------------------------------------
Problem: In the transactions "All Time" section, the system displays all data at once. 
This heavy load slows down the website and causes slight lag.

Proposed Solution: Limit the display to 10 records at a time, then load another 10 
when scrolling down (infinite scroll / pagination). Apply this to other sections as well, 
not just "All Time".

2. Calendar Logic Incomprehensible
----------------------------------
Problem: The current calendar logic is unclear and does not provide an accurate 
basis for generating reports.

Proposed Solution: Implement the calendar directly inside the logic so that clients 
can generate clear and accurate reports of gasoline performance.

3. Dark Mode Feature
--------------------
Problem: No dark mode feature is available in the system, limiting user experience.

Proposed Solution: Add a dark mode toggle or automatic theme detection.

4. Tedious Dependency Installation
----------------------------------
Problem: Each Python dependency must be installed manually, which is time-consuming.

Proposed Solution: Provide a single requirements.txt file that contains all dependencies, 
allowing developers to install everything with one command:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Transaction Edit Button Malfunction
--------------------------------------
Problem: In the transactions section, the Edit button only works once. After a single edit, 
it becomes unresponsive unless the browser is restarted. Additionally, the icon disappears, 
leaving only the text visible.

Proposed Solution: 
- Option A: Remove the icon and fix the button functionality. 
- Option B: Fix both the button functionality and the icon rendering.

6. Customer Search Feature Misbehavior
--------------------------------------
Problem: When searching for a customer, the system limits results to 10 for performance, 
but the search logic prioritizes place values incorrectly. For example:
- Searching for "Customer 5" shows "Customer 504" and similar entries instead of directly showing "Customer 5".
- Searching for "Customer 99" fails to display it first if higher place value matches exist (e.g., 199, 299).
I think it also happen on the other sector (html) as well

Proposed Solution: 
- Fix search query to prioritize exact matches before partial matches.
- Adjust SQL LIKE or query filters to ensure "Customer 5" is shown before "Customer 504".
- Optionally, provide two modes: exact match search and partial match search.

7. Search Input Clear Button Issue
----------------------------------
Problem: Pressing the "X" on the search input box causes the entire HTML page to restart/refresh, 
instead of simply clearing the search field.

Proposed Solution: 
- Prevent the default browser behavior on the clear (X) button. 
- Implement JavaScript to only clear the input value without triggering a page reload.
- Ensure the search results are reset gracefully when input is cleared.

Status & Remarks: Pending

8. Customer Generation Confirmation & Management
------------------------------------------------
Problem: The "Generate Customer" feature immediately creates a new loyalty member without 
any confirmation. If clicked by mistake, it instantly adds a new customer record. Additionally:
- There is no option to delete or edit customer records.
- Customer name is not required/recorded, making data management difficult since only IDs/numbers exist.

Proposed Solution:
- Add a confirmation prompt (e.g., "Are you sure you want to generate a new customer?").
- Implement customer record management: allow editing (e.g., name, details) and deleting if needed.
- Require at least a name field when generating customers for easier identification.

Status & Remarks: Pending

9. Empty Dashboard
------------------
Problem: The current system dashboard is empty and does not provide any useful 
information or overview to the user. Without visualizations, it lacks quick insights 
into system performance or customer activity.

Proposed Solution:
- Populate the dashboard with meaningful elements such as:
  - Recent transactions summary
  - Calendar with scheduled/recorded activities
  - Graphs showing sales and reward trends
  - Key performance metrics (e.g., total customers, total points distributed)
- Provide a blueprint-style layout for clarity and easy navigation.
